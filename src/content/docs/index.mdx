## How to use this site

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Keystatic](https://keystatic.com/).

This page, and any other, is written in Markdown. You can edit it by clicking the edit button below, or by editing the file in the `src/content/docs` folder.

You can create "collections" into the system by editing the `keystatic.config.ts` file:
```ts

const collectionConfig = (
  label: string,
  path: string,
  subcategories: string[],
) => ...


/** Main Keystatic Config */

export default config({
  collections: {
    processes: collectionConfig("Processes", "processes", []),
    guides: collectionConfig("Guides", "guides", []),
    research: collectionConfig("Research", "research", []),
  },
  ...
});
```

The `collectionConfig` configuration is setup to mimic the expected FrontMatter schema provided by Starlight.

### Notable issues
- If you are pasting a screenshot in Starlight will not assign it a random name - just `image.{png,jpg,webp}` - you will need to rename it to be unique. Do this by right clicking on the image once you have pasted it.
